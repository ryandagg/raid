# Rogue AI Dungeon - enhanced

Cloned from [Bovard/raid](https://github.com/bovard/raid) and modified to expose as an npm package. The FE client code has been moved to it's own repo. 

This purpose of this package is two-fold:
1) Provide game engine to run an FE client that will ultimately be used for game running and a high score board.
2) Expose portions of the game engine so that users can unit test their code against the actual source.

A Rogue-like game based on the [battlecode](http://battlecode.org) API. We hope this game will be fun and help people prepare to compete in battlecode!
